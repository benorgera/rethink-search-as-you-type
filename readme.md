# Usage

To install and launch run: `npm i && npm run dev`, then open `localhost:3000`

The UI was found on https://github.com/elastic/search-ui, and is loaded with the default dataset of national parks. I chose to use existing Elastic Search code for this challenge, rather than to reinvent the wheel, because I knew they support search as you type out of the box. In most cases search is best accomplished using existing tools for indexing. Hence why this task only took me around 10 lines of code.
